sndspc.jl: Pattern Spaces for Sound

Josh Berson, josh@joshberson.net
May 2017

What:
- Extract spectral envelope features from short segments of an audio recording
- Embed feature space in a lower-dim space suitable for visualization and learning

Why:
- Explore ways of heuristically representing phenomenologically significant
  features of sound and observing how they change over time

  dimensionality reduction ensemble approach (2013)

# Load in a recording
# Split it into samples
# Get MFCCs and SFs
# Optional: Reduce with ICA -- 10 dof? ... and t-SNE?
# Graph
# Cluster with k-means and EM
# Classify with SVM -- what's the target dimension?

function extractFeatures( sample )
  #=
  Generates a feature vector for the spectral envelope of an audio sample
  Features:
  * MFCC coefs 1â€“13: mean, variance, skew, kurtosis
  * As above for MFCC gradient and Hessian
  * Spectral flatness in log bands: mean, variance, skew, kurtosis

  First MFC coefficient is log power, less useful for speech recognition
  but possibly useful for pattern space visualization

  Returns features as (Vector, Dict)
